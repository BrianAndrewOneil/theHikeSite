## How It's Made

**Tech used:** HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Bootstrap, Node.js, Express, MongoDB

I built this social media platform to allow users to create an account and then post pics and descriptions of their hikes. There's a shared feed so that users can see everyone's hikes and can click into individual posts to read more, like, comment, etc.

## Optimizations
Future enhancements for this app will include allowing users to curate a list of their favorite hikes, and allowing posters to include multiple images of their hikes.

## Lessons Learned
This project was a deep dive into MVC architecture and features of express & middleware like nodemon, passport, cloudinary, multer, etc.
